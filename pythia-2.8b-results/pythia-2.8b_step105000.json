CTS's sales were lower in the UK primarily due to a decrease in system development work in London and the negative impact of currency exchange rates. CTS's average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS sales of $22.2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Australian dollar.",
