The IRS generally has adopted a \"series\" approach to tax accounting and determination. Under the series approach, the annual effective tax rate is determined by dividing the total tax payable for the year by the total tax payable for the prior year. In effect, the year-to-year effective tax rate is the same as the short-term effective tax rate. The short-term effective tax rate is the tax rate used in the current year to calculate tax liabilities for the current year and the long-term effective tax rate is the tax rate used in the prior year to calculate tax liabilities for the prior year.",
