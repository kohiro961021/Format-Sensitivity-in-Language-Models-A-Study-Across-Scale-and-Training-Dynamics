This increase was primarily driven by higher margins on increased work on development projects in New York, Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area and Brisbane.

Amortization of purchased intangibles was $22 million in 2019 compared to $5.2 million in 2018. The increase is due to the amortization of purchased intangibles for companies acquired by CTS in fiscal year 2019. CTS operating income increased 28% in 2019 compared to 2018. This increase was partially offset by operating losses incurred by businesses acquired by CTS in fiscal year 2019. CTS Adjusted EBITDA increased 51% in 2019 compared to 2018.

Businesses acquired by CTS during fiscal year 2019, whose operations are all located in the U.S., had sales of $74.4 million in fiscal year 2019. Sales increased slightly in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in service sales. Sales were lower in the UK primarily due to a decrease in system development work in London and the negative impact of currency exchange rates. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS sales of $22.2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Australian dollar.",
