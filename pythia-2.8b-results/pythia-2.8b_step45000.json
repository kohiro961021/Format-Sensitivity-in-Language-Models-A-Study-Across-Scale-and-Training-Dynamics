Sales increased slightly in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in service sales. Sales were lower in the UK primarily due to a decrease in system development work in London and the negative impact of currency exchange rates. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS sales of $22.2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Australian dollar.",

      "csv_string_response": "In answer to your question, the change in the percentage to net sales for segment operating income (loss) between 2017 and 2018 was primarily due to higher net sales in the distributor channel across all the APAC and EMEA regions of $13.7 million, a $3.3 million increase in net sales in the OEM channel across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions, a $4.2 million increase in the EMS channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions, and a $7.6 million improvement in gross margin.",
      "json_rows_response": "In 2018, operating income (loss) increased $1.2 million from $9.0 million of operating loss in 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales, as well as the benefit of completed restructuring activities. The increase was also attributed to an $11.7 million improvement in (gain) loss on the write down and disposal of long-lived assets. These improvements were partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in restructuring charges, a $0.7 million increase in SG&A expenses, and a $0.6 million increase in R&D expenses."
