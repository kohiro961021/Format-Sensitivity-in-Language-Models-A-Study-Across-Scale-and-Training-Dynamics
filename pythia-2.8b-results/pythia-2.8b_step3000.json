The cash balance of the Goodwill, Inc. for the period ending June 30, 2018, is $1.0 million of tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. Any associated interest and penalties imposed would affect the tax rate. As of May 27, 2018, our gross liability for unconsolidated subsidiaries over total liabilities in 2018 was $32.5 million, excluding a related liability of $7.7 million for gross interest and penalties.
