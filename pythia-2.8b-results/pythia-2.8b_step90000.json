In periods in which the Company has a net loss, dilutive common stock equivalents are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.\nThe table below presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company incurred net losses and accordingly excluded common stock equivalents for outstanding stockbased awards, which represented all potentially dilutive securities, of 2.5 million, 3.7 million, and 4.5 million, respectively, from the calculation of diluted net loss per share due to their anti-dilutive nature.",

The effective tax rate of (66)% for fiscal year 2019, differs from the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate of 21% mainly due to permanent differences for stock-based compensation, including excess tax benefits, research and development credits, the tax rate differences between the United States and foreign countries, foreign withholding taxes, and certain non-deductible expenses including executive compensation. As of July 31, 2019, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $6.2 million that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law which substantially changed U.S. tax law, including a reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and several provisions that may impact us in current and future periods."
