Net Income (Loss) Per Share\nBasic earnings per share, or EPS, is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period and the weighted-average number of dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method.\nFor purposes of this calculation, common stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards are considered to be common stock equivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted EPS when their effect is dilutive. In periods in which the Company has a net loss, dilutive common stock equivalents are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.\nThe table below presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company incurred net losses and accordingly excluded common stock equivalents for outstanding stockbased awards, which represented all potentially dilutive securities, of 2.5 million, 3.7 million, and 4.5 million, respectively, from the calculation of diluted net loss per share due to their anti-dilutive nature.",
      "json_rows_response": "The Company incurred net losses of $0.14 for the year ended December 31, 2019, and thus excluded $0.38 of dilutive common stock equivalents for the computation of diluted earnings per share."

Sales in 2019 were higher in the U.S. primarily due to system development on contracts in New York, Boston, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Businesses acquired by CTS during fiscal year 2019, whose operations are all located in the U.S., had sales of $74.4 million in fiscal year 2019. Sales increased slightly in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in service sales. Sales were lower in the UK primarily due to a decrease in system development work in London and the negative impact of currency exchange rates. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS sales of $22.2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Australian dollar.
