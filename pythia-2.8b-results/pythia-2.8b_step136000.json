(Golden Ridge). The primary activity of the business is the operation of a rice mill in Wynne, Arkansas. We acquired the business as part of our strategy to vertically integrate in order to leverage our proprietary technologies for producing SRB and derivative products. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. The results of Golden Ridge’s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning November 28, 2018. In 2018, we incurred $0.1 million of Golden Ridge acquisition-related costs which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe purchase price for Golden Ridge was subject to adjustment if the estimated working capital with respect to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed at the time of closing was different than the actual closing working capital, as defined in the purchase agreement. We revised our preliminary estimate of the working capital adjustment as indicated in the table below.

The increase in sales was primarily driven by growth in both organic and inorganic business in North America. Sales in 2019 were higher in the U.S. primarily due to system development on contracts in New York, Boston, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Businesses acquired by CTS during fiscal year 2019, whose operations are all located in the U.S., had sales of $74.4 million in fiscal year 2019. Sales increased slightly in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in service sales. Sales were lower in the UK primarily due to a decrease in system development work in London and the negative impact of currency exchange rates. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS sales of $22.2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Australian dollar."
