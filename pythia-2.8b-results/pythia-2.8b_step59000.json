A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis.

If one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.\nSpecific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments mainly include: • Dealer quotes for similar instruments; • The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves; and • Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for financial instruments."
