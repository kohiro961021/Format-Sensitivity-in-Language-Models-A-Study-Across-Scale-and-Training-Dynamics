To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on region and ageing. Customers with heightened credit risk are provided for specifically based on historical default rates and forward looking information.

These improvements were partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in restructuring charges, a $0.7 million increase in SG&A expenses, and a $0.6 million increase in R&D expenses."
