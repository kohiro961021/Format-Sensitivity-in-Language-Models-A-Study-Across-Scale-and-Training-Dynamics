The increase in capital expenditures in Wireless was a result of investments made to upgrade our wireless network to continue delivering reliable performance for our customers. We continued augmenting our existing LTE network with 4.5G technology investments that are also 5G-ready to prepare for the commercial launch of 5G in select markets in early 2020. In 2019, we acquired spectrum licences for $1,731 million, which is not included in the table above. See “Managing Our Liquidity and Financial Resources”.\n2. The decrease in capital expenditures in Cable was a result of lower purchases of customer premise equipment and lower investments related to the initial launch of Ignite TV. We have continued upgrading our network infrastructure with additional fibre deployments, including increasing our fibre-to-the-home and fibre-to-the-curb distribution. These upgrades will lower the number of homes passed per node and incorporate the latest technologies to help deliver more bandwidth and an even more reliable customer experience as we progress in our Connected Home roadmap.\n3. The increase in capital expenditures this year was a result of higher investments in renovations at various Toronto Blue Jays facilities, partially offset by lower investment in our broadcast and IT infrastructure and the sale of our publishing business.",
