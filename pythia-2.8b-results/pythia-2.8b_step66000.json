      "gold_answer": 234,
      "markdown_table_response": "The increase in capital expenditures in Wireless this year was a result of investments made to upgrade our wireless network to continue delivering reliable performance for our customers. We continued augmenting our existing LTE network with 4.5G technology investments that are also 5G-ready to prepare for the commercial launch of 5G in select markets in early 2020. In 2019, we acquired spectrum licences for $1,731 million, which is not included in the table above. See “Managing Our Liquidity and Financial Resources”.\nCABLE The decrease in capital expenditures in Cable this year was a result of lower purchases of customer premise equipment and lower investments related to the initial launch of Ignite TV. We have continued upgrading our network infrastructure with additional fibre deployments, including increasing our fibre-to-the-home and fibre-to-the-curb distribution. These upgrades will lower the number of homes passed per node and incorporate the latest technologies to help deliver more bandwidth and an even more reliable customer experience as we progress in our Connected Home roadmap.\nMEDIA The increase in capital expenditures this year was a result of higher investments in renovations at various Toronto Blue Jays facilities, partially offset by lower investment in our broadcast and IT infrastructure and the sale of our publishing business",

Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring services to a customer (“transaction price”). The Company will then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When determining the transaction price of the contract, an adjustment is made if payment from a customer occurs either significantly before or significantly after performance, resulting in a significant financing component."
