If one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.\nSpecific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments mainly include: Dealer quotes for similar instruments; The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves; Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for financial instruments.",

The increase in net sales was primarily driven by an increase in net sales in the distributor channel across all the APAC and EMEA regions of $13.7 million, a $3.3 million increase in net sales in the OEM channel of the EMEA region and a $4.2 million increase in the EMS channel across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of $1.2 million in the OEM channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. In addition, there was a favorable impact of $7.6 million from foreign currency exchange primarily due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.\nReportable Segment Operating Income (Loss)\nSegment operating income of $3.6 million in fiscal year 2018 improved $12.7 million from $9.0 million of operating loss in fiscal year 2017"

The increase was primarily attributable to a $4.3 million increase in gross margin driven by higher net sales, as well as the benefit of completed restructuring activities. The increase was also attributed to an $11.7 million improvement in (gain) loss on the write down and disposal of long-lived assets. These improvements were partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in restructuring charges, a $0.7 million increase in SG&A expenses, and a $0.6 million increase in R&D expenses.",
