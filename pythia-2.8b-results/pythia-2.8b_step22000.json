It is the difference between the fair value of an asset and the amount that the owner would have to pay to obtain it. It is measured by the difference between the amount of assets that have been invested and the amount that would be needed to complete the project.

The carrying amount would be divided by the number of years of the company’s existence and the amount would be multiplied by the annual rate of return.

Sales increased slightly in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in service sales. Sales were lower in the UK primarily due to a decrease in system development work in London and the negative impact of currency exchange rates. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS sales of $22.2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Australian dollar.",
