The Group has applied the new standard on 1 July 2018 using a simplified approach for measuring expected credit losses relating to trade receivables using a lifetime expected loss allowance. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on region and ageing. Customers with heightened credit risk are provided for specifically based on historical default rates and forward looking information. Where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, balances are written-off. The application of the standard did not result in any significant impact on the measurement of the allowance for doubtful debtors.",
