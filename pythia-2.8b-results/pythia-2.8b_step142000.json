The increase in net sales was primarily driven by an increase in net sales in the distributor channel across all the APAC and EMEA regions of $14.1 million, a $3.7 million increase in net sales in the OEM channel across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions and a $4.8 million increase in the EMS channel across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of $1.4 million in the OEM channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. In addition, there was a favorable impact of $7.1 million from foreign currency exchange primarily due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar."
