The execution of business customer contracts and the roll-out of fixed WTTP to more homes and businesses led to lower capital expenditures. The reduced capital expenditures in 2019 were also due to a modest reduction in capital expenditures in the wireline segment in 2018, as we continued to focus our investments on the ongoing deployment of FTTP to more homes and businesses, the connection of fibre Internet and TV services to more homes and businesses and the execution of business customer contracts."
