Included in the balance at May 26, 2019 are $1.0 million of tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. Any associated interest and penalties imposed would affect the tax rate. As of May 27, 2018, our gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $32.5 million, excluding a related liability of $7.7 million for gross interest and penalties. Interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations was an expense of $1.2 million in fiscal 2019, an expense of $1.6 million in fiscal 2018, and a benefit of $0.3 million in fiscal 2017.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial",

The Group has applied the new standard on 1 July 2018 using a simplified approach for measuring expected credit losses relating to trade receivables using a lifetime expected loss allowance. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on region and ageing. Customers with heightened credit risk are provided for specifically based on historical default rates and forward looking information. Where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, balances are written-off. The application of the standard did not result in any significant impact on the measurement of the allowance for doubtful debtors.\n3. Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Debts which are known to be uncollectable are written off by reducing the carrying amount directly.
