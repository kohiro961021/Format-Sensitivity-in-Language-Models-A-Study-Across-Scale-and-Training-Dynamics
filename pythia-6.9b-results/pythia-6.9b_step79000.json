      "markdown_table_response": "The annual effective tax rate is impacted by how the taxing authority estimates the ultimate deductibility of the tax positions. If the taxing authority estimates the deductibility to be longer than the shorter deductibility period, then the tax effect of the tax positions is deferred until the taxing authority estimates the deductibility to be longer. The annual effective tax rate would increase to the extent the taxing authority estimates the deductibility to be longer. If the taxing authority estimates the deductibility to be shorter than the shorter deductibility period, then the tax effect of the tax positions would be paid when the taxing authority estimates the deductibility to be shorter. The annual effective tax rate would decrease to the extent the taxing authority estimates the deductibility to be shorter. The longer the deductibility period, the higher the annual effective tax rate, and the shorter the deductibility period, the lower the annual effective tax rate.",

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on region and ageing. Customers with heightened credit risk are provided for specifically based on historical default rates and forward looking information. Where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, balances are written-off. The application of the standard did not result in any significant impact on the measurement of the allowance for doubtful debtors.\nCollectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
