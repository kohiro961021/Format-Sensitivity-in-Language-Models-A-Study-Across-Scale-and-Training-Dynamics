The U.S. sales increased 27% to $849.8 million in 2019 compared to $670.7 million in 2018. The increase was primarily driven by the adoption of ASC 606 and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Australian dollar. In addition, the sales in the U.S. increased due to the growing market share in new systems. The increased sales in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in service sales. The sales in the UK were lower in the fiscal year 2019 compared to 2018 due to the decrease in service sales.",
