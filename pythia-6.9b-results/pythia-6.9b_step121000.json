The tax benefit available to offset the tax liability is the amount by which the tax liability is reduced by the amount of the tax benefit. For example, if a tax liability of $100 million is reduced by a tax benefit of $20 million, the tax benefit reduces the tax liability to $80 million. The tax benefit available to offset the tax liability is not necessarily the tax benefit that is ultimately recognized. The tax benefit available to offset the tax liability is the tax benefit available at the time that the tax liability is recognized. The tax benefit available to offset the tax liability is the tax benefit that is available when the tax liability is recognized.\nThe tax effect of temporary differences and carryforwards that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following:\nThe liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at May 26, 2019 was $44.1 million, excluding a related liability of $11.7 million for gross interest and penalties.

Sales increased slightly in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in service sales. Sales were lower in the UK primarily due to a decrease in system development work in London and the negative impact of currency exchange rates. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS sales of $22.2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Australian dollar.",
