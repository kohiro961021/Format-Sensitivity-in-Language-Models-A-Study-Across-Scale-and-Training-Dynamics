Included in the balance at May 26, 2019 are $1.0 million of tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. Any associated interest and penalties imposed would affect the tax rate. As of May 27, 2018, our gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $32.5 million, excluding a related liability of $7.7 million for gross interest and penalties. Interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations was an expense of $1.2 million in fiscal 2019, an expense of $1.6 million in fiscal 2018, and a benefit of $0.3 million in fiscal 2017.",

This is not an unusual situation. Companies need to recognize deferred tax assets at a faster rate than they pay tax on the income that those assets will generate.\nThe company's effective tax rate was not affected because the net deferred tax liability was $1.0 million higher at the end of the year than it was at the end of the year. This was because the company recognized deferred tax assets at a higher rate in the year in which they were recognized.",
