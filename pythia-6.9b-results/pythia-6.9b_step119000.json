In 2019, we acquired spectrum licences for $1,731 million, which is not included in the table above. See “Managing Our Liquidity and Financial Resources”.\nThe decrease in capital expenditures in Cable this year was a result of lower purchases of customer premise equipment and lower investments related to the initial launch of Ignite TV. We have continued upgrading our network infrastructure with additional fibre deployments, including increasing our fibre-to-the-home and fibre-to-the-curb distribution. These upgrades will lower the number of homes passed per node and incorporate the latest technologies to help deliver more bandwidth and an even more reliable customer experience as we progress in our Connected Home roadmap.\nThe increase in capital expenditures this year was a result of higher investments in renovations at various Toronto Blue Jays facilities, partially offset by lower investment in our broadcast and IT infrastructure and the sale of our publishing business.\nCor",

The increase in net sales was primarily driven by an increase in net sales in the distributor channel across all the APAC and EMEA regions of $7.5 million, a $2.0 million increase in net sales in the OEM channel of the EMEA region and a $3.9 million increase in the EMS channel across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of $1.3 million in the OEM channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. In addition, there was a favorable impact of $5.3 million from foreign currency exchange primarily due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar."
