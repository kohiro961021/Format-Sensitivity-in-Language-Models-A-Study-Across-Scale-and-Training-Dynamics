It introduces a new model for classifying financial assets and financial liabilities. This model is based on the recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, and on the identification of the present value of expected credit losses relating to financial assets and financial liabilities. The Group has applied the new standard on 1 July 2018 using a simplified approach for measuring expected credit losses relating to financial assets. The Group has also introduced a new impairment model for financial assets. The new standard applies to all financial assets and financial liabilities.\nFinancial assets are classified into three groups: financial assets that are recognised at amortised cost, less any provision for impairment; financial assets that are recognised at amortised cost, less any provision for impairment and financial assets that are recognised at fair value. Financial liabilities are classified into two groups: financial liabilities that are recognised at amortised cost, less any provision for impairment and financial liabilities that are recognised at fair value. The Group’s approach for measuring expected credit losses relating to financial assets is based on the effective interest method. This method involves the application of a lifetime expected loss allowance to the financial assets. The Group’s approach for measuring expected credit losses relating to financial liabilities is",

The increase in sales was primarily driven by growth in both organic and inorganic business in North America. Sales in 2019 were higher in the U.S. primarily due to system development on contracts in New York, Boston, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Businesses acquired by CTS during fiscal year 2019, whose operations are all located in the U.S., had sales of $74.4 million in fiscal year 2019. Sales increased slightly in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in service sales. Sales were lower in the UK primarily due to a decrease in system development work in London and the negative impact of currency exchange rates. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS sales of $22.2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Australian dollar."
