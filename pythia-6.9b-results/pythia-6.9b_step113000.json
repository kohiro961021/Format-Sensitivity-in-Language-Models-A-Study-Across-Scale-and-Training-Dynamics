      "csv_string_response": "\"Income tax\" is the name of the tax; the rate is the \"effective tax rate.\" The \"effective\" is important because the tax is a tax, not an expense. The \"rate\" is important because it is an adjustment to the \"effective\" tax rate.\n\"Gross unrecognized tax benefits\" are the same as \"unrecognized deferred tax assets and liabilities,\" so the correct answer is \"yes.\"",
