We made an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We have elected the current period expense method. In December 2018, the IRS issued proposed regulations related to the BEAT tax, which we are in the process of evaluating. If the proposed BEAT regulations are finalized in their current form, the impact may be material to the tax provision in the quarter of enactment.\nC.
