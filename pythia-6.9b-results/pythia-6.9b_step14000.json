Sales in 2019 were higher in the U.S. primarily due to a 28% increase in organic growth in the U.S. and a 37% increase in sales in the UK, primarily due to a 25% increase in organic growth in the UK. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS sales of $22.2 million in 2019 compared to 2018.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangibles: Amortization of purchased intangibles included in the CTS operating results totaled $5.2 million in 2019 and $5.7 million in 2018. The increase is due to the amortization of purchased intangibles for companies acquired by CTS in fiscal year 2019.\nOperating Income: CTS operating income increased $3.6 million in 2019 to $77.2 million, primarily due to higher margins on increased work on development projects in New York, Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area and Brisbane,"
