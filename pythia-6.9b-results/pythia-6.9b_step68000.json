Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. Any associated interest and penalties imposed would affect the tax rate.

      "markdown_table_response": "This is a great question that is not just about accounting. It is also about tax policy and risk. The short answer is that the tax law and the tax code provide for the deferral of tax until the tax liability is determined. In the case of a liability for which there is significant uncertainty, the deferred tax asset has no value. The decision to defer the tax liability for the liability is at the discretion of the taxing authority. The taxing authority may elect to defer the tax liability even if the liability is not fully deductible. In this case, the tax liability is treated as a liability that will give rise to a future tax deduction. The liability is not treated as a liability for which there is a corresponding tax deduction.",
