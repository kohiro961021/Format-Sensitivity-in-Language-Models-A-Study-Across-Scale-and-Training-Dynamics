      ],
      "markdown_table_response": "For tax purposes, the impact of deferred tax accounting is that the period of potential tax benefits is shorter than it is in the income statement. For example, if a company has $1.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits at fiscal year-end, and a taxing authority has a period of potential tax benefits of five years, the period of potential tax benefits is five years. In the income statement, however, the period of potential tax benefits is only two years. Therefore, the impact of deferred tax accounting is that a company will have to pay tax on its deferred tax assets (and liabilities) earlier than it would have in the income statement. However, the effective tax rate will not be affected by the time at which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are paid.",
      "csv_string_response": "Because the deferred tax assets and liabilities were recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations under the historical cost method, the effect of the accounting change was that the deferred tax assets and liabilities were recognized in a manner that was more favorable than the tax basis used in the determination of income tax expense.",
      "json_rows_response": "The final answer is that the carryforwards, which gave rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities, resulted in deferred tax assets and liabilities. The liability for the carryforwards was deductible over a longer period than the liabilities.
