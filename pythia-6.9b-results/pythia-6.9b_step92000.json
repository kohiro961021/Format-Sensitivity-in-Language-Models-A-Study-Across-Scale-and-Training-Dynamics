In this case, the tax rate is equal to the effective tax rate minus the carryforward of the deferred tax asset or liability. The carryforward of the deferred tax asset or liability represents a tax liability that will be paid in the future. If the deferred tax asset or liability is not recognized when the tax liability is paid, it is not included in the tax rate.
