      "json_rows_response": "\"The increase in amortization of purchased intangibles was primarily caused by the increase in the amortization of purchased intangible assets. The amortization of purchased intangible assets was $19.3 million in fiscal year 2019 compared to $10.1 million in fiscal year 2018. The increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets was partially offset by operating losses incurred by companies acquired by CTS during fiscal year 2019. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS operating income of $3.6 million in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018. The decrease in operating income was primarily caused by the higher exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the British pound and Australian dollar.\""
