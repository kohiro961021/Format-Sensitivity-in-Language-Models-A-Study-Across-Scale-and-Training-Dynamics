This means that a loss is recognized when there is a tax benefit, but not when there is a tax benefit and a deduction.\n- In general, a tax benefit is recognized at the date of the transaction that gives rise to the tax benefit.\n- Therefore, when there is a tax benefit, it is a deferred tax asset.\n- The deferred tax asset is recognized over the entire remaining life of the tax benefit.\n- A tax benefit that is not deductible at the time of the transaction will be deductible in the future. This means that the deferred tax asset will be recognized over the entire remaining life of the tax benefit.\n- In the case of a tax benefit that is deductible at the time of the transaction, the tax benefit is a current deduction, and the deferred tax asset is recognized over the remaining life of the current deduction.\n- If a taxpayer recognizes a tax benefit that is not deductible at the time of the transaction,",
