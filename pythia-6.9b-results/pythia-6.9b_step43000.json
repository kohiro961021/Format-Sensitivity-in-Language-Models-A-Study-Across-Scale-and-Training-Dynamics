      "gold_answer": 68.8,
      "markdown_table_response": "Average annual operating income in 2019 was $75.5 million, compared to $66.1 million in 2018. The increase in operating income in 2019 was primarily due to higher margins on increased work on development projects in New York, Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area and Brisbane as well as the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. These increases in operating income were partially offset by operating losses incurred by businesses acquired by CTS in fiscal 2019. Businesses acquired by CTS in fiscal years 2019 incurred operating losses of $10.1 million in fiscal 2019, which included acquisition transaction costs of $8.1 million and amortization of intangible assets totaling $19.3 million. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currency in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS operating income of $3.6 million for 2019 compared to 2018.",
