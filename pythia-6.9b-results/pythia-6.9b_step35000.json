The increase in operating income in 2019 was primarily due to higher operating margins on increased work on development projects in New York, Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area and Brisbane as well as the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in operating income of $3.6 million for 2019 compared to 2018."
