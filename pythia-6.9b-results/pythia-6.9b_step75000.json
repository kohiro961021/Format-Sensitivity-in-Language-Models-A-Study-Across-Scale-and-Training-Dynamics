Unless terminated sooner, the Plan will continue in effect until April 30, 2028.\nWe measure the fair value of RSAs based on the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. We recognize the expense associated with RSAs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which generally ranges from immediate vesting to a four year vesting period.\nWe implemented an ongoing performance-based incentive program under the Plan. The performance-based incentive program provides for annual grants of PSAs. PSAs are restricted stock that are issued, to the extent earned, at the end of each performance cycle.\nUnder the performance-based incentive program, each participant is given a target award expressed as a number of shares"
