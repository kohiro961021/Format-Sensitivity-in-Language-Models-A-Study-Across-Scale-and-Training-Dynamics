The increase in operating income was primarily caused by higher margins on increased work on development projects in New York, Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area and Brisbane, as well as the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. These increases in operating income were partially offset by operating losses incurred by businesses acquired by CTS in fiscal 2019 as well as the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Businesses acquired by CTS in fiscal years 2019 incurred operating losses of $10.1 million in fiscal 2019, which included acquisition transaction costs of $8.1 million and amortization of intangible assets totaling $19.3 million.

Businesses acquired by CTS during fiscal year 2019, whose operations are all located in the U.S., had sales of $74.4 million in fiscal year 2019. Sales increased slightly in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in service sales. Sales were lower in the UK primarily due to a decrease in system development work in London and the negative impact of currency exchange rates. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS sales of $22.2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Australian dollar."
