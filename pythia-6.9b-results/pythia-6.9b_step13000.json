ASC 606 was a new measure for the non-recurring operating income (loss) and operating income (loss) categories, as well as an analysis for the non-recurring revenue (revenue less than the operating loss) and non-recurring revenue (revenue greater than the operating loss) segments. ASC 606 is a long-form net income statement that was released in April 2018. The original measure has been revised several times since its release and was updated by ASC 606."
