The increase in sales was driven by increased system development work in New York, Boston, and the San Francisco Bay Area as well as the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in sales was partially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS sales of $22.2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Australian dollar. The increase in sales was partially offset by lower operating income for CTS as a result of increased demand for systems in New York, Boston, and the San Francisco Bay Area as well as the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.",
