In other words, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as $50,000-($50,000-adjusted EBITDA).

We also believe that the settlement of the third quarter litigation contributed to the increase in our litigation expense for the second quarter of 2018 because it provided some additional certainty about our future litigation expenses and also eliminated the need to calculate an additional adjustment to reflect a potential increase in future litigation expense."
