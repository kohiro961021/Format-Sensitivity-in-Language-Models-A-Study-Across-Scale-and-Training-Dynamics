CTS was developed for small and medium businesses that are facing a shortage of intangibles and a potential loss of value. ASC 606 has been adopted as the primary revenue recognition standard in the United States and is used in some jurisdictions across the globe. For companies that have adopted ASC 606, the percentage increase in CTS sales is primarily due to a reduction in the number of intangibles they need to increase their sales. The increase in intangibles used to be used to reduce the risk of losing value. The implementation of ASC 606 is an important step in the development of a new revenue recognition standard.",
