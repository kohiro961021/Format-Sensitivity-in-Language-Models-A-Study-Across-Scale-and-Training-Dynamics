In addition, we did not identify any significant changes to our business processes, systems, and controls to support recognition and disclosure requirements under the new guidance. We adopted the provisions of Topic 606 in fiscal 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective method. We recorded a $0.5 million cumulative effect adjustment, net of tax, to the opening balance of fiscal 2019 retained earnings, a decrease to receivables of $7.6 million, an increase to inventories of $2.8 million, an increase to prepaid expenses and other current assets of $6.9 million, an increase to other accrued liabilities of $1.4 million, and an increase to other noncurrent liabilities of $0.2 million. The adjustments primarily related to the timing of recognition of certain customer charges, trade promotional expenditures, and volume discounts.\nThe effect of the changes made to our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 26, 2019 for the adoption of Topic 606 was as follows",

Sales in 2019 were higher in the U.S. primarily due to system development on contracts in New York, Boston, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Businesses acquired by CTS during fiscal year 2019, whose operations are all located in the U.S., had sales of $74.4 million in fiscal year 2019. Sales increased slightly in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in service sales. Sales were lower in the UK primarily due to a decrease in system development work in London and the negative impact of currency exchange rates. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS sales of $22.2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Australian dollar."
