      "question": "What was the change in the percentage to net sales for segment operating income (loss) between 2017 and 2018?",
      "gold_answer": 6.8,
      "markdown_table_response": "Net sales for the fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were $202.0 million and $182.2 million, respectively. Operating income (loss) in 2018 increased $19.7 million or 10.8% from $182.2 million in 2017. The increase in operating income (loss) was primarily driven by an increase in operating income (loss) in the distributor channel across all the APAC and EMEA regions of $13.7 million, a $3.3 million increase in operating income (loss) in the OEM channel of the EMEA region and a $4.2 million increase in the EMS channel across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in operating income (loss) of $1.2 million in the OEM channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions.",
