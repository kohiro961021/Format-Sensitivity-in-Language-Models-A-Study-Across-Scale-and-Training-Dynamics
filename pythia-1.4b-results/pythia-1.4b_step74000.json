The revenue generated from the contracts with customers is primarily a function of the amount of consideration the customer expects to receive in exchange for transferring services to the customer. The revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations under the contract are satisfied, which occurs when control of the promised service is transferred to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring services to the customer. The Company will then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When determining the transaction price of the contract, an adjustment is made if payment from a customer occurs either significantly before or significantly after performance, resulting in a significant financing component. None of the Company’s licenses and collaboration agreements contained a significant financing component at either December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nThe Company’s existing license and collaboration agreements may contain a single performance obligation or may contain multiple performance obligations. Those which contain multiple performance obligations will require an allocation of the transaction price based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised services underlying each performance obligation.
