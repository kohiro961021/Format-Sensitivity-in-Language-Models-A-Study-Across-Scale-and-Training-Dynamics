The numbers of companies that we have seen in fiscal years 2019 and previous years are not as impressive as the numbers of companies that we have seen in fiscal years 2018 and 2019.

The adoption of ASC 606 accelerated the growth in CTS operating income in 2018 and 2019 as the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 decreased.
