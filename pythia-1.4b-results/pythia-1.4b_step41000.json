This increase was primarily driven by higher margins on increased work on development projects in New York, Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area and Brisbane, as well as the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. These increases in operating income were partially offset by operating losses incurred by businesses acquired by CTS in fiscal 2019 as well as the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Businesses acquired by CTS in fiscal years 2019 incurred operating losses of $10.1 million in fiscal 2019, which included acquisition transaction costs of $8.1 million and amortization of intangible assets totaling $19.3 million.
