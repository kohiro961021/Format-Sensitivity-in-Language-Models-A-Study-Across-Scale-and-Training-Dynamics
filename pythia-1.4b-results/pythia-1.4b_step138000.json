In order to calculate the bonus, the Board of Directors has determined that the market value of the options granted to the non-employee director should be based on the grant date fair value of the options. This is because the non-employee director would receive his/her award or grant based on the market value of the options granted to him/her on the grant date, which is the date on which the options are granted. Since the market value of the options is not known until the option grant date, the value of the options at the grant date is the best available value for the non-employee director’s award or grant. The non-employee director’s obligation to pay the bonus is based on the difference between the market value of the options granted to the non-employee director at the grant date and the value of the options at the grant date. Therefore, the value of the options at the grant date should be adjusted for",
