When determining the transaction price of the contract, an adjustment is made if payment from a customer occurs either significantly before or significantly after performance, resulting in a significant financing component. None of the Company’s licenses and collaboration agreements contained a significant financing component at either December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nThe Company’s existing license and collaboration agreements may contain a single performance obligation or may contain multiple performance obligations.
