The decrease was primarily driven by a $3.3 million increase in net sales in the distributor channel across all APAC and EMEA regions of $13.7 million, a $3.2 million increase in net sales in the OEM channel across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions, and a $4.2 million increase in the EMS channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of $1.2 million in the OEM channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. In addition, there was a favorable impact of $7.6 million from foreign currency exchange primarily due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar."
