There are several factors that make the fair value of financial instruments very difficult to measure.\nFirst, the financial instruments may be subject to more than one form of hedging. For example, a financial instrument may be subject to forward market swaps (FMS) which are contracts that specify how a financial instrument is to be allocated among other financial instruments. The pricing structure of FMSs is also subject to change.\nSecond, the financial instruments may be subject to changes in market liquidity. For example, some financial instruments may be subject to de-lending. This occurs when a financial instrument is sold to a buyer that does not take into account the full value of the financial instrument. The value of the financial instrument may be discounted, and the value of the discount may be added to the price paid for the financial instrument.\nThird, the financial instruments may be subject to technical limitations. For example, financial instruments may be subject to price limits. Price limits may also apply to forward market swaps, or other types of financial instruments.\nFinally, the financial instruments may be subject to a trade-off. For example, one financial instrument may be more expensive than another financial instrument.",

Sales increased in North America primarily due to growth in both organic and inorganic business in North America. Sales in 2019 were higher in the U.S. primarily due to system development on contracts in New York, Boston, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Businesses acquired by CTS during fiscal year 2019, whose operations are all located in the U.S., had sales of $74.4 million in fiscal year 2019. Sales increased slightly in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in service sales. Sales were lower in the UK primarily due to a decrease in system development work in London and the negative impact of currency exchange rates.
