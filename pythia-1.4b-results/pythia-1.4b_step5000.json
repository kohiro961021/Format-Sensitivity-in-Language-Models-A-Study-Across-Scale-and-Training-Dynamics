This is the typical result of a company with a net loss of $4 million, but with a net loss of $3 million.\nWe have assumed that a company's net loss per share is equal to its common shares outstanding. If the Company has a net loss of $3 million, it is entitled to receive a net loss of $3.5 million.

In addition, a decrease in the amount of gross margin driven by the adoption of ASC 606, due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar, was partly offset by a $4.3 million decrease in SG&A expenses, and a $4.3 million increase in R&D expenses.",
