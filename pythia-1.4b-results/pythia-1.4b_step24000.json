      "json_rows_response": "The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets is calculated with reference to quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. These instruments are included in level 2.\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required for evaluating the fair value of a financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 3.\nIf one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.\nSpecific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments mainly include: • Dealer quotes for similar instruments; • The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves; and • Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for financial instruments."
