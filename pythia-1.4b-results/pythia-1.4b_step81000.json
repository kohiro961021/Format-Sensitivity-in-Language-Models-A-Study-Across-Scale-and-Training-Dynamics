The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS sales of $22.2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Australian dollar.",

Sales in 2019 were higher in the U.S. primarily due to system development on contracts in New York, Boston, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Businesses acquired by CTS during fiscal year 2019, whose operations are all located in the U.S., had sales of $74.4 million in fiscal year 2019. Sales increased slightly in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in service sales. Sales were lower in the UK primarily due to a decrease in system development work in London and the negative impact of currency exchange rates. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS sales of $22.2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Australian dollar.",

You will need to calculate the percent change in revenue by multiplying the total revenue by the percent change in revenue. For example, if the revenue was $1 million in fiscal year 2019 and the percent change in revenue was 10% and the revenue was $1.1 million in fiscal year 2018, the percent change in revenue in fiscal year 2019 would be 10% * $1 million = $10 million. The percent change in revenue in fiscal year 2018 would be 10% * $1 million = $100,000. The percent change in Adjusted EBITDA would be the percent change in revenue multiplied by the percent change in Adjusted EBITDA, which would be 50% * $100,000 = $50,000.",
