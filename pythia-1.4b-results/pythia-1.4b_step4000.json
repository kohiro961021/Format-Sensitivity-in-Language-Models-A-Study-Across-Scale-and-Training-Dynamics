In fact, there is a clear signal to the reader that the gross margin of the product for the year 2018 was not the same as that for the year 2017. The reason for this is not clear, however, because the net sales were close to $200,000,000. The average of the first three months of 2018 was $182,000, which is only a bit over $200,000,000. The average of the last two months of 2018 was $77,000, which is only a bit over $200,000,000.
