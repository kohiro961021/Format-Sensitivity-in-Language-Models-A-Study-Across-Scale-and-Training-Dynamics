The goodwill is also estimated by applying a discount rate to the future cash flows to reflect the risk of loss. We believe that the discounted value of the future cash flows is equal to the present value of the future cash flows.\nThe goodwill is the sum of the present value of the expected future cash flows of the business and the estimated future cash flows of the business to the date of acquisition. Goodwill is measured by comparing the projected present value of the future cash flows of the business to the estimated future cash flows of the business as of the date of acquisition.\nThe goodwill is calculated by using a discount rate of 4.5% (the statutory discount rate) and a net operating loss carryforward of $0.2 million at December 31, 2018. The goodwill is calculated by using a discount rate of 4",
