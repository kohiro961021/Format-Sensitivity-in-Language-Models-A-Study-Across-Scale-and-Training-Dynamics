The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2019, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in millions):\n(1) Operating lease obligations include $18.1 million of future lease payments which is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet as of March 31, 2019. This obligation is due under an operating lease from our acquisition of Atmel for a building in San Jose, California.\n(2) Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for construction or purchases of property, plant and equipment. These obligations were not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet as of March 31, 2019, as we have not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property.\n(3) Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and outstanding purchase commitments with our wafer foundries.\n(4) The Term Loan Facility matures on May 29, 2025.\n(5) For purposes of this table, we have assumed that the principal of our 2023 revolving loans outstanding at March 31, 2019 will be paid on May 18, 2023,",

The Group has applied the new standard on 1 July 2018 using a simplified approach for measuring expected credit losses relating to trade receivables using a lifetime expected loss allowance. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on region and ageing. Customers with heightened credit risk are provided for specifically based on historical default rates and forward looking information. Where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, balances are written-off. The application of the standard did not result in any significant impact on the measurement of the allowance for doubtful debtors.\nCollectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Debts which are known to be uncollectable are written off by reducing the carrying amount directly"
