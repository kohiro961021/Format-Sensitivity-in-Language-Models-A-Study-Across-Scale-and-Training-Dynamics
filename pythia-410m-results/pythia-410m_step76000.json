Adjusted EBITDA was a useful measure of financial performance and reflects the amount of our cash on hand as of the end of the financial year. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands).",
      "json_rows_response": "In the report on our executive bonus plan, we included a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, and we also included Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of our core operating results, which we used in our stockholder's equity and cash flow analysis. Adjusted EBITDA does not include depreciation and amortization, which are non-cash charges. Although we exclude the depreciation and amortization charges, they are not a substitute for an analysis of our operating performance as reported under GAAP. We also excluded other non-GAAP items, including our working capital requirements. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors."
