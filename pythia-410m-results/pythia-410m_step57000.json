In periods in which the Company has a net loss, dilutive common stock equivalents are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.\nThe table below presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company incurred net losses and accordingly excluded common stock equivalents for outstanding stockbased awards, which represented all potentially dilutive securities, of 2.5 million, 3.7 million and 4.5 million, respectively, from the calculation of diluted net loss per share due to their anti-dilutive nature."
