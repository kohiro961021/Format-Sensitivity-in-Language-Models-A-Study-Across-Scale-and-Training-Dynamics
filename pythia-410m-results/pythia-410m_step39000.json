The impact of the adoption of ASC 606 in fiscal year 2019 is the largest increase in Adjusted EBITDA for a year for any company that operates a CTS business. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606, which is the new revenue recognition standard. The adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, which was implemented in fiscal year 2018, was partially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

The increase in sales was primarily driven by growth in both organic and inorganic business in North America. Sales in 2019 were higher in the U.S. primarily due to system development work on contracts in New York, Boston, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Businesses acquired by CTS during fiscal year 2019, whose operations are all located in the U.S., had sales of $74.4 million in fiscal year 2019. Sales increased slightly in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in service sales. Sales were lower in the UK primarily due to a decrease in system development work in London and the negative impact of currency exchange rates. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS sales of $22.2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the strengthening of",
