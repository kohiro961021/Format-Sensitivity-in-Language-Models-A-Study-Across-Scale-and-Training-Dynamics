This is mainly due to the combination of a slowdown in business activity and a decline in the number of subscribers and subscribers-to-network. Cable subscribers are still a small number in terms of active subscribers, but they are growing rapidly due to the expanded and diversified spectrum coverage. We are operating at capacity and we are making good progress in our business, but we are still a small number in terms of active subscribers. We are also facing a declining subscriber base, which is a direct result of a slowdown in business activity."
