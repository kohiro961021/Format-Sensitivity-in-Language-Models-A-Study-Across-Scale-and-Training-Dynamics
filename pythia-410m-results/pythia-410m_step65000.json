You have also calculated the weighted average number of shares outstanding for both the basic and diluted earnings per share. The weighted average number of shares outstanding for the basic earnings per share is 1.4 times the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per share. This means that the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the basic earnings per share is 2.4 times the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per share. The weighted average number of shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per share is 2.24 times the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the basic earnings per share. These results show that the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per share is 2.24 times the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the basic earnings per share. Therefore, the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per share is 2.24 times the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the basic earnings per share."
