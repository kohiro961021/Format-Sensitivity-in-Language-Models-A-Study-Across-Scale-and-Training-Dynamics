The Tax Treatment of Disallowances Act directs the Federal Tax Court to determine whether a disallowance of a deduction or deduction adjustment would be likely to affect the tax treatment of a disallowance.

The Group has applied the new standard on 1 July 2018 using a simplified approach for measuring expected credit losses relating to trade receivables using a lifetime expected loss allowance. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on region and ageing. Customers with heightened credit risk are provided for specifically based on historical default rates and forward looking information. Where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, balances are written-off. The application of the standard did not result in any significant impact on the measurement of the allowance for doubtful debtors.\nCollectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis.

The increase in sales was primarily driven by growth in both organic and inorganic business in North America. Sales in 2019 were higher in the U.S. primarily due to system development on contracts in New York, Boston, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Businesses acquired by CTS during fiscal year 2019, whose operations are all located in the U.S., had sales of $74.4 million in fiscal year 2019. Sales increased slightly in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in service sales. Sales were lower in the UK primarily due to a decrease in system development work in London and the negative impact of currency exchange rates.
