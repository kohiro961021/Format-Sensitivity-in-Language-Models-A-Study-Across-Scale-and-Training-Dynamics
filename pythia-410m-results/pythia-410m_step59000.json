Businesses acquired by CTS during fiscal year 2019, whose operations are all located in the U.S., had sales of $74.4 million in fiscal year 2019. Sales increased slightly in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of currency exchange rates. Sales were lower in the UK primarily due to a decrease in system development work in London and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates.
