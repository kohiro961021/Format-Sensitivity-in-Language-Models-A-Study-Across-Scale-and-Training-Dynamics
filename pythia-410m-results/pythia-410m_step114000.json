      "markdown_table_response": "Segment operating income (loss) decreased $12.7 million or $0.1% from $9.0 million in fiscal year 2017 to $3.6 million in fiscal year 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a $4.3 million increase in gross margin driven by higher net sales, as well as the benefit of completed restructuring activities. The decrease was also attributed to an $11.7 million improvement in (gain) loss on the write down and disposal of long-lived assets. These improvements were partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in restructuring charges, a $0.7 million increase in SG&A expenses, and a $0.6 million increase in R&D expenses.",
