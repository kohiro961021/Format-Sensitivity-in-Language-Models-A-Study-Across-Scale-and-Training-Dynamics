      "markdown_table_response": "Segment operating income (loss) of $3.6 million in fiscal year 2018 improved $12.7 million from $9.0 million of operating loss in fiscal year 2017. The improvement was primarily attributed to a $4.3 million increase in gross margin driven by higher net sales, as well as the benefit of completed restructuring activities. The increase was also attributed to an $11.7 million improvement in (gain) loss on the write down and disposal of long-lived assets. These improvements were partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in restructuring charges, a $0.7 million increase in SG&A expenses, and a $0.6 million increase in R&D expenses.",
