The shares were issued in January 2020, however, no contingencies existed as of the date of the acquisition.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the weighted average shares outstanding for the basic and diluted loss per share computations (in thousands, except share and per share data):\nAt December 31, 2018 and 2018 there were 383,000 and 750,000 incremental shares, respectively, from the assumed exercise of stock options that were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because of the anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share. There were 308,000 restricted stock awards excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended 2018 and 113,000 for the fiscal year ended 2018.",
