      "gold_answer": 6.8,
      "markdown_table_response": "Net sales for segment operating income (loss) decreased $1.1 million in fiscal year 2018 compared to $1.4 million in fiscal year 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a $3.3 million decrease in net sales in the distributor channel across all the APAC and EMEA regions of $13.7 million, a $3.3 million decrease in net sales in the OEM channel of the EMEA region, and a $3.3 million decrease in the EMS channel across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions. The decrease in net sales was partially offset by a $4.2 million decrease in net sales in the OEM channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. In addition, there was a favorable impact of $7.6 million from foreign currency exchange primarily due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.",
