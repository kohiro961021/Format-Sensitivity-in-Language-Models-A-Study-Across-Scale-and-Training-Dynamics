        "12.7"
      ],
      "markdown_table_response": "Segment operating income in fiscal year 2018 increased $19.7 million from $182.2 million in fiscal year 2017. The increase in segment operating income was primarily driven by an increase in net sales in the distributor channel across all the APAC and EMEA regions of $13.7 million, a $3.3 million increase in net sales in the OEM channel of the EMEA region and a $4.2 million increase in the EMS channel across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of $1.2 million in the OEM channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. In addition, there was a favorable impact of $7.6 million from foreign currency exchange primarily due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar. The increase in segment operating income was partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in restructuring charges, a $0.7 million increase in SG&A expenses, and a $0.6 million increase in R&D expenses.",
      "csv_string_response": "Segment operating income (loss) increased $19.7 million or 10.8% from $182.2 million in fiscal year 2017 and increased $13.7 million or 10.8% from $13.7 million in fiscal year 2018.",
      "json_rows_response": "Segment operating income of $3.6 million in fiscal year 2018 increased $12.7 million from $9.0 million of operating loss in fiscal year 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to a $4.3 million increase in gross margin driven by higher net sales, as well as the benefit of completed restructuring activities. The increase was also attributed to an $11.7 million improvement in (gain) loss on the write down and disposal of long-lived assets. These improvements were partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in restructuring charges, a $0.7 million increase in SG&A expenses, and a $0.6 million increase in R&D expenses. The net effect of these changes was a net operating loss of $5.8 million, primarily attributable to the $10.0 million change in net sales."
