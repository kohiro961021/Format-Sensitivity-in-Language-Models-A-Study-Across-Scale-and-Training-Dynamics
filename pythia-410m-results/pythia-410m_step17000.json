Included in the weighted average shares outstanding is the share consideration in connection with the Restaurant Magic Acquisition (See Note 2 - Acquisitions) in the amount of 908,192 for the fiscal year ended 2019. The shares were issued in January 2020, however, no contingencies existed as of the date of the acquisition.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the weighted average shares outstanding for the basic and diluted loss per share computations (in thousands, except share and per share data):\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018 there were 383,000 and 750,000 incremental shares, respectively, from the assumed exercise of stock options that were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because of the anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share. There were 308,000 restricted stock awards excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended 2019 and 113,000 for the fiscal year ended 2018."

Sales in 2019 were higher in the U.S. primarily due to system development on contracts in New York, Boston, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Sales increased slightly in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in service sales.

Sales in 2019 were higher in the U.S. primarily due to system development on contracts in New York, Boston, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Sales increased slightly in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in service sales.
