      "csv_string_response": "The final answer to the user's question was that CTS's operating income remained unchanged in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the significant impact of the adoption of ASC 606. The increased operating income was primarily driven by the growth of CTS, primarily due to its CTS acquisition transaction costs increasing $10.1 million in fiscal 2019, which included acquisition transaction costs of $8.1 million and amortization of intangibles of $19.3 million.\nAmortization of intangibles: CTS amortized $3.6 million in fiscal 2019 to $110.5 million in fiscal 2018. The increase in amortization of intangibles was primarily caused by a decrease in the amount of amortization of intangibles purchased by CTS in fiscal 2019 as compared to 2018. The amount of amortization of intangibles purchased was substantially offset by the negative impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. The increase in amortization of intangibles was primarily driven by the increase in amortization of purchased intangibles for companies acquired by CTS in fiscal 2019.\nOperating Income: CTS operating income increased 23% in 2019 to $77.2 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $",

Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by the increase in amortization of purchased intangibles for companies acquired by CTS in fiscal 2019, which resulted in a decrease in adjusted EBITDA of $3.6 million.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangibles: Amortization of purchased intangibles included in the CTS operating results totaled $2.2 million in 2019 compared to $1.1 million in 2018.
