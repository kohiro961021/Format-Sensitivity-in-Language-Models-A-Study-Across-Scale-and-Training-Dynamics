      "csv_string_response": "The change in net sales for segment operating income (loss) between 2017 and 2018 was $20.8 million, primarily driven by a $9.0 million increase in net sales in the distributor channel. Net sales increased to $202.0 million in fiscal year 2018, $182.2 million in fiscal year 2017, and $182.7 million in fiscal year 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by the increase in net sales in the distributor channel across all the APAC and EMEA regions of $13.7 million, a $3.3 million increase in net sales in the OEM channel of the EMEA region and a $4.2 million increase in the EMS channel across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of $1.2 million in the OEM channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. In addition, there was a favorable impact of $7.6 million from foreign currency exchange primarily due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.",
