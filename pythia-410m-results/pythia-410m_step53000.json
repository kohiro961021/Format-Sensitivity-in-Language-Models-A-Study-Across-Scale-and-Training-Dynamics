      "question": "What was the change in the percentage to net sales for segment operating income (loss) between 2017 and 2018?",
      "gold_answer": 6.8,
      "markdown_table_response": "The change in the percentage to net sales for segment operating income (loss) between 2017 and 2018 was $8.2 million for fiscal year 2017 and $9.0 million for fiscal year 2018. In both years, the change was primarily driven by an increase in net sales in the distributor channel across all the APAC and EMEA regions of $13.7 million, a $3.3 million increase in net sales in the OEM channel of the EMEA region and a $4.2 million increase in the EMS channel across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of $1.2 million in the OEM channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. In addition, there was a favorable impact of $7.6 million from foreign currency exchange primarily due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.",

      "json_rows_response": "Net sales increased $19.7 million in fiscal year 2018, resulting in a net loss of $6.9 million. This increase was primarily due to an increase in net sales in the distributor channel across all the APAC and EMEA regions of $13.7 million, a $3.3 million increase in net sales in the OEM channel of the EMEA region and a $4.2 million increase in the EMS channel across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions.
