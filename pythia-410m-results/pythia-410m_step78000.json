      "gold_answer": 6.8,
      "markdown_table_response": "Net sales increased from $182.2 million to $202.0 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by an increase in net sales in the distributor channel across all the APAC and EMEA regions of $13.7 million, a $3.3 million increase in net sales in the OEM channel of the EMEA region and a $4.2 million increase in net sales in the EMS channel across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of $1.2 million in the OEM channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. In addition, there was a favorable impact of $7.6 million from foreign currency exchange primarily due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.",

These increases were partially offset by a $3.3 million decrease in net sales of $1.2 million in the OEM channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. The decrease in net sales in the OEM channel was largely due to the acquisition of a P&G unit in the EMEA region and the sale of a P&G unit in the APAC region. In addition, the decrease in net sales in the OEM channel was partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in SG&A expenses. The increase in net sales in the EMS channel was largely offset by the $0.6 million"
