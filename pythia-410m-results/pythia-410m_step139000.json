We continued augmenting our existing LTE network with 4.5G technology investments that are also 5G-ready to prepare for the commercial launch of 5G in select markets in early 2020.\nThe decrease in wireless capital expenditure in 2019 was a result of lower purchases of customer premise equipment and lower investments related to the initial launch of Ignite TV. We have continued upgrading our network infrastructure with additional fibre deployments, including increasing our fibre-to-the-home and fibre-to-the-curb distribution. These upgrades will lower the number of homes passed per node and incorporate the latest technologies to help deliver more bandwidth and an even more reliable customer experience as we progress in our Connected Home roadmap.\nWe continue to invest in our broadcast and IT infrastructure and the sale of our publishing business.",

Trade receivables generally have 30 to 90 day terms.\nAASB 9 Financial Instruments This standard addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model based on expected credit losses for the impairment of financial assets. The Group has applied the new standard on 1 July 2018 using a simplified approach for measuring expected credit losses relating to trade receivables using a lifetime expected loss allowance. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on region and ageing. Customers with heightened credit risk are provided for specifically based on historical default rates and forward looking information. Where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, balances are written-off. The application of the standard did not result in any significant impact on the measurement of the allowance for doubtful debtors.\nCollectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Debts which are known to be uncollectable are written off by reducing the carrying amount directly",
