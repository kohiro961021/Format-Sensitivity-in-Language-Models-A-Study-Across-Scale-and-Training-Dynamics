The main factors that contributed to sales increases were changes in foreign currency exchange rates and increase in the amount of bought intangibles in the U.S. in 2019. However, there was little change in the amount of acquired intangibles as a result of the increased adoption of ASC 606. This increase was primarily driven by the ability of business owners to sell and acquire intangibles in order to satisfy their needs. The addition of ASC 606 reduced the amount of acquired intangibles in the U.S. in 2019 to $46.4 million in 2019. The change was primarily driven by increased costs in the UK as a result of the introduction of ASC 606. The increased cost of acquiring intangibles led to a significant decrease in CTS revenue in the UK and also led to a decrease in CTS sales in the UK. The increase in CTS sales in the UK was primarily driven by increased system development work on development projects in New York, Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area, and the San Francisco Bay Area.
