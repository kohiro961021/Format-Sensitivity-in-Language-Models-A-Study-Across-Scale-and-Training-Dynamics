This is what makes the acquisition of spectrum licences a significant factor in the increase in capital expenditures. I believe this is because there is an increase in the amount of capital expenditure that is incurred in each acquisition. Since these acquisitions are to be conducted by the acquiring company, the acquisition of spectrum licences by the acquiring company is a significant factor in the increase in capital expenditures.
