      "csv_string_response": "The current answer is that Adjusted EBITDA for CTS was $110.5 million in 2019 compared to $73.3 million in 2018, which was due to the adoption of ASC 606 and the inclusion of certain changes in currency exchange rates to the American dollar to support the increase in operating income. Adjusted EBITDA for CTS increased by $1.9 million in 2019 as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was partially offset by operating losses incurred by businesses acquired by CTS in fiscal 2019 as well as the negative impact of the currency exchange rates. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for CTS in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Australian dollar. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for CTS in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the increasing impact of currency exchange rates on the U.S. dollar.
