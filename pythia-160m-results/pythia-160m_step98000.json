Value Added (VA)\nThis question is a user-question that asks what is the ratio of the user's to the value of the company's (time-based) investment in the product to the value of the company's (duration-based) investment in the product. To answer this question, we use a simple measure to measure the ratio of the user's to the value of the company's (time-based) investment in the product to the value of the company's (duration-based) investment in the product. A value is valued when the ratio of the user's to the value of the company's investment in the product exceeds the ratio of the user's to the value of the company's investment in the product.",

The Effective Tax Rate for Fiscal Year 2018 is the U.S. Treasury's estimate of how much money and income is to be used for the benefit of the public.\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018, differs from the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate of 21% mainly due to permanent differences for stock-based compensation, including excess tax benefits, research and development credits, the tax rate differences between the United States and foreign countries, foreign withholding taxes, and certain non-deductible expenses including executive compensation.\nAs of July 31, 2019, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $6.2 million that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Internal Revenue Service issued proposed regulations related to the BEAT tax, which we are in the process of evaluating. If the proposed regulations are finalized in their current form, the impact may be material to the tax provision in the quarter of enactment.",
