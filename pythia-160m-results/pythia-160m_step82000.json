To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on region and ageing.

Where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, balances are written-off. The application of the standard did not result in any significant impact on the measurement of the allowance for doubtful debtors.\nCollectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis.

This increase in net amortization was primarily due to higher margins on increased projects in New York, Boston, and the San Francisco Bay Area. The decrease in amortization of purchased intangibles was partially offset by a reduction in operating losses incurred by businesses acquired by CTS in fiscal 2019 as well as the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Businesses acquired by CTS in fiscal 2019 had a 13% amortization of purchased intangibles in fiscal 2019 compared to 2017."
