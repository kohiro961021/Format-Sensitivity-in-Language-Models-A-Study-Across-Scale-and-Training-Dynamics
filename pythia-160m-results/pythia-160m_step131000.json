Sales increased slightly in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of currency exchange rates. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS operating income of $3.6 million for 2019 compared to 2018.\nOperating Income:",
      "json_rows_response": "Because sales in 2019 were more favorable for CTS compared to 2018, we performed a detailed analysis of the results. The average year-over-year increase in sales for CTS was $10.1 million. This increase was primarily driven by the higher margin on increased work on development projects in New York, Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area and Brisbane, as well as the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. The average year-over-year increase in sales for CTS was $11.4 million, which was primarily driven by the higher margin on increased work on development projects in New York, Boston, and the Valley."
