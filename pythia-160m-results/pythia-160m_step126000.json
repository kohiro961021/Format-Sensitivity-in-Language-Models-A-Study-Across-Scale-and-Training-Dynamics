The term 'uncollectable' has been used in the past in reference to cases where a debt is in fact uncollectable, including such as debt being paid off by an insolvent business, or debt being paid off by a debtor having a credit rating of 'excellent'. In this sense, debt is not uncollectable. The debt may be uncollectable, but it may not be in fact uncollectable. It is highly likely that the debt would not have been paid off by the insolvent business or the debtor has a credit rating of 'excellent'.

Where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, balances are written-off. The application of the standard did not result in any significant impact on the measurement of the allowance for doubtful debtors.\nCollectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Debts which are known to be uncollectable are written off by reducing the carrying amount directly. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is raised when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments (more than 60 days overdue) are considered indicators that the trade receivable may be impaired. The amount of the impairment allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at"

Businesses acquired by CTS in fiscal year 2019 incurred operating losses of $18.5 million in fiscal year 2019.
