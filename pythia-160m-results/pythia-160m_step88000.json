The $8.3 million contribution to the tax benefit is allocated to the tax benefit from the Tax Act, including the one-time provisional net charge. This is equivalent to a one-time provisional tax benefit. In addition, we can claim the same tax benefit as an income tax benefit as well, as we have to administer our tax obligations under the Tax Act.\nThe final answer to the user question is that the tax benefit is not limited to the income tax benefit, but rather is a single-payer tax benefit. The tax benefit was an exclusion of taxes due on capital gain, profit, and depreciation from the tax benefit. The tax benefit from the Tax Act is an exclusion of the tax benefit from the tax benefit. The tax benefit from the Tax Act is a tax benefit that is non-deductible.
