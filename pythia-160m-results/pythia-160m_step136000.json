The mobile services will have the additional capacity and reach that we need to provide to customers in the short term and the long term. In the short term, these investments are projected to increase the value of the mobile and wireless services. We believe the difference between the costs and the value of the mobile and wireless services will be much greater than the differences between the costs of the wireless and the mobile and wireless services.\nThe additional capacity and reach of wireless services can be purchased through a variety of providers, such as the Mobile Data Connect (MCDC) provider, the Wireless Data Connection (WDC), the AT&T wireless data connection provider, or a combination of all of these. For example, one MCDC provider currently offers the Mobile Data Connect service for $5.8 million per year and the WDC service for $4.8 million per year.

The increase in net sales was mainly driven by an increase in net sales of $3.6 million in fiscal year 2018 and an increase in net sales of $3.6 million in fiscal year 2017.
