      "json_rows_response": "The change in the percentage to net sales for segment operating income (loss) in fiscal year 2018 was $11.7 million, which was a $0.6 million increase in net sales of $7.6 million in fiscal year 2017. The decrease in net sales from the previous year was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales from the OEM channel, OMEA, and APAC regions and the reduction in the EMS channel. This decrease in net sales was primarily due to the reduction in the gross margin driven by the increase in the euro compared to the U.S. dollar, which is partially offset by a decrease in the SG&A expenses and a $0.7 million increase in R&D expenses."
