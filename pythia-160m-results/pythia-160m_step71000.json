This valuation technique maximises the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required for evaluating the fair value of a financial instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 3.\nIf the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques, the instrument is included in level 3.\nSpecific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments mainly include: • Dealer quotes for similar instruments; • The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves; and • Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for financial instruments."

Net Income (Loss) Per Share\nBasic earnings per share, or EPS, is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, and weighted-average number of dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method.\nFor purposes of this calculation, common stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards are considered to be common stock equivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted EPS when their effect is dilutive. In periods in which the Company has a net loss, dilutive common stock equivalents are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.\nThe table below presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company incurred net losses and accordingly excluded common stock equivalents for outstanding stockbased awards, which represented all potentially dilutive securities, of 3.5 million, 5.0 million, and 1.4 million, respectively, from the calculation of diluted EPS.",
