However, it is a common experience for many people to come away feeling like they have \"been there, done that\" in the industry. The most common reason is a lack of an effective, nationalized network to deliver reliable network performance.\nTo our knowledge, the only reported study of the impact of a nationalized network on the number of wireless subscribers was conducted by the Toronto Telecommunications Association, a non-profit organization that provides information about the economic impact of a nationalized network. The study was conducted for the first time on a nationalized network. While there are a number of factors that could affect the distribution of wireless spectrum licenses in Canada, most of these factors are not considered in this study.\nAt the time of the study, the cost of installing a nationalized network was $4.5 billion. This figure is estimated to have been incurred by the government of Canada in the past four years. The estimated cost of $4.5 billion was based on the cost of the main infrastructure components, including the installation of the public switched telephone network and the building and expansion of the"
