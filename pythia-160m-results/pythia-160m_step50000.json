Net sales were $2.1 million for fiscal year 2017, $1.3 million for fiscal year 2017, and $0.9 million for fiscal year 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in net sales in the distributor channel across all the APAC and EMEA regions of $6.1 million, a $1.3 million increase in net sales in the OEM channel of the EMEA region and a $0.6 million increase in the EMS channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. These increases were partially offset by a $1.1 million improvement in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar."
