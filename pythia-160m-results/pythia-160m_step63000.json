To measure expected credit losses, trades receivables are grouped based on region and ageing.

      "markdown_table_response": "In the final question, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the operating results of CTS was only compared to the change in operating income. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the operating results of CTS was primarily due to the increase in CTS sales of $3.6 million in fiscal 2019 and $6.3 million in 2018, which resulted in a decrease in operating income in FY 2019. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the higher percentage of international business which had sales of $5.2 million in fiscal 2019 and $6.3 million in 2018. The decrease in operating income primarily resulted in lower employee pay scales in 2019 compared to the year before, which led to the increased impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on CTS. The impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard by CTS was primarily due to the expansion of international business in the U.S., the expansion of our foreign operations and the negative impact on CTS sales. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the operating results of CTS was primarily due to the expansion of the number of international businesses in the U.S. that were available to CTS to expand overseas operations.",
