In addition, we did not identify any significant changes to our business processes, systems, and controls to support recognition and disclosure requirements under the new guidance.

In this technique, the prior value is calculated as the actual value of the financial instrument that has been valued in the prior valuation, based on the actual value of the financial instrument that has been valued by the prior valuation. The prior value is taken as the future value of the financial instrument that has been valued by the prior valuation, and it is then compared to the level 2 value of the financial instrument. In this process, the level 2 valuation is calculated using the prior value of the financial instrument and the level 2 valuation is then compared to the level 2 value of the financial instrument. The level 2 valuation is usually not accurate because of the nature of the financial instrument and the factors that are considered in the prior valuation technique. The prior valuation technique is a more accurate method for valuing financial instruments than the level 2 valuation technique because it is based on the underlying value of the financial instrument. For example, if the financial instrument has been valued in the prior valuation, the prior value of the financial instrument is usually a better valuation technique than the level 2 valuation technique.
