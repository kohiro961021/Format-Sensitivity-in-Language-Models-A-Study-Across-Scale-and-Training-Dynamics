      "csv_string_response": "Sales in the U.S. increased by 24% in 2019 to $1.5 million compared to $1.2 million in 2018. The increase in sales was primarily due to increased business activity on the U.S. dollar and increased business growth in the UK. Sales in 2019 were higher in the U.S. primarily due to a decrease in U.S. dollar exchange rate. The increase in sales was primarily driven by lower margins on increased work on contracts in New York, Boston, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Businesses acquired by CTS in fiscal year 2019 had sales of $74.4 million in fiscal year 2019. Sales were lower in the UK primarily due to a decrease in U.S. dollar exchange rate. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS operating income of $3.6 million in 2019 compared to 2018.",
