INCOME TAXES\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for income tax purposes. The components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in thousands):\nAs of September 27, 2019, we had $923.4 million of gross federal net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards consisting of $479.2 million relating to our acquisition of BinOptics Corporation in 2014 and $259.1 million relating to our acquisition of BinOptics Corporation in 2014 and $259.1 million relating to losses generated by MACOM.\nThe NOL carryforward period is infinite. The reported net operating loss carryforward includes any limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which applies to an ownership change as defined under Section 382."
