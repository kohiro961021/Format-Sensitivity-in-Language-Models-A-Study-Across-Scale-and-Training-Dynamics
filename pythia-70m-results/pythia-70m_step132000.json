      "json_rows_response": "Table 5-7 shows the results of the three current surveys of all of our Income Taxian's income from 2017 and 2017. The income from 2017 has a greater effect on the percentage of net sales, which is offset by a lower net sales in the OEM channel. The net sales increase in 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in gross margin driven by higher net sales, which is offset by a lower net sales in the OEM channel and a $4.3 million increase in the EMS channel."
