In 2019, we acquired spectrum licences for $1,731 million, which is not included in the table above. See “Managing Our Liquidity and Financial Resources”.\nCABLE The decrease in capital expenditures in Cable this year was a result of lower purchases of customer premise equipment and lower investments related to the initial launch of Ignite TV. We have continued upgrading our network infrastructure with additional fibre deployments, including increasing our fibre-to-the-home and fibre-to-the-curb distribution. These upgrades will lower the number of homes passed per node and incorporate the latest technologies to help deliver more bandwidth and an even more reliable customer experience as we progress"
