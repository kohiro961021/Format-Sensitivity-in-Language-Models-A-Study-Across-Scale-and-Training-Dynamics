The Group has applied the new standard on 1 July 2018 using a simplified approach for measuring expected credit losses relating to trade receivables using a lifetime expected loss allowance. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on region and ageing. Customers with heightened credit risk are provided for specifically based on historical default rates and forward looking information. Where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, balances are written-off. The application of the standard did not result in any significant impact on the measurement of the allowance for doubtful debtors.\nCollectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis.

We also use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, as performance measures under our executive bonus plan. Further, we believe the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis and, in the case of exclusion of acquisition-related expense and certain historical legal expenses, excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors."
