The amount of the contribution is based on the number of years of taxable income that would be required to be included in the taxing authority's liability on the basis of the short and long deductibility periods. The contribution is computed as the amount of the taxing authority's tax liability in the taxable year that would have been reduced by the shorter deductibility period. In the tax year that would have been reduced by the shorter deductibility period, the tax liability would have been reduced by the amount of the contribution.

The average exchange rates between the prevailing currency in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS sales of $22.2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Australian dollar.",
