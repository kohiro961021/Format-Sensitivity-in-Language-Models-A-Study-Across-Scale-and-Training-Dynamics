      "csv_string_response": "The increase in wireless capital expenditures in Wireless this year was a result of investments made to upgrade our wireless network to continue delivering reliable performance for our customers. We continued augmenting our existing LTE network with 4.5G technology investments that are also 5G-ready to prepare for the commercial launch of 5G in select markets in early 2020. In 2019, we acquired spectrum licences for $1,731 million, which is not included in the table above. See “Managing Our Liquidity and Financial Resources”.\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nCapital expenditures include costs associated with acquiring property, plant and equipment and placing it into service. The telecommunications business requires extensive and continual investments, including investment in new technologies and the expansion of capacity and geographical reach. Expenditures related to the acquisition of spectrum licences and additions to right-of-use assets are not included in capital expenditures and do not factor into the calculation of free cash flow or capital intensity. See “Managing Our Liquidity and Financial Resources”.\nCapital expenditures are significant and have a material impact on our cash flows; therefore, our management teams focus on planning, funding, and managing them.

Sales increased slightly in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in service sales. Sales were lower in the UK primarily due to a decrease in system development work in London and the negative impact of currency exchange rates. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS sales of $22.2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Australian dollar.\n  Operating income: CTS operating income increased 28% in 2019 to $77.2 million"
