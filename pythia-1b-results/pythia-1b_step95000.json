Where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, balances are written-off.

Second, we are also improving our network to support growth in the 5G segment, as well as expanding our data centre capacity. The capital expenditures are driven by the following:\n• Continued expansion of our wireless network, as we continue to expand LTE-A network capacity, while maintaining the speeds of LTE and 5G.\n• Improved network capacity, especially in rural areas, as we continue to expand our fiber backhaul.\n• Increased coverage, particularly in rural areas, as we continue to deploy fixed WTTP to more homes and businesses, and to increase the size of our network.\n• Improved capital intensity ratio, as we continue to expand 5G capacity, deploy more fibre to serve more homes and businesses, and to expand our data centre capacity.",
