Net sales increased $2.1 million or 10.8% from $182.2 million in fiscal year 2017.\n2. Segment operating income (loss) of $3.6 million in fiscal year 2018 improved $12.7 million from $9.0 million of operating loss in fiscal year 2017. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in net sales in the distributor channel across all the APAC and EMEA regions of $13.7 million, a $3.3 million increase in net sales in the OEM channel of the EMEA region and a $4.2 million increase in the EMS channel across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of $1.2 million in the OEM channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. In addition, there was a favorable impact of $7.6 million from foreign currency exchange primarily due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.",
