We conducted a review of the impact of the guidance on the consolidated financial statements to identify material differences, if any, that would result from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts. We also undertook a review of our consolidated financial statements to identify material differences, if any, that would result from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts. We adopted the provisions of Topic 606 in fiscal 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective method. We recorded a $0.5 million cumulative effect adjustment, net of tax, to the opening balance of fiscal 2019 retained earnings, a decrease to receivables of $7.6 million, an increase to inventories of $2.8 million, an increase to prepaid expenses and other current assets of $6.9 million, an increase to other accrued liabilities of $1.4 million, and an increase to other noncurrent liabilities of $0.2 million.
