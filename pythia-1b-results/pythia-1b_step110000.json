      "question": "What was the change in the percentage to net sales for segment operating income (loss) between 2017 and 2018?",
      "gold_answer": 6.8,
      "markdown_table_response": "Net sales of $202.0 million in fiscal year 2018 increased $19.7 million or 10.8% from $182.2 million in fiscal year 2017. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in net sales in the distributor channel across all the APAC and EMEA regions of $13.7 million, a $3.3 million increase in net sales in the OEM channel of the EMEA region and a $4.2 million increase in the EMS channel across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of $1.2 million in the OEM channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. In addition, there was a favorable impact of $7.6 million from foreign currency exchange primarily due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.",

      "json_rows_response": "The percentage to net sales for segment operating income (loss) increased from 12.3% in fiscal year 2017 to 13.1% in fiscal year 2018. The increase was driven by the positive impact of the $4.3 million increase in net sales, the benefit of completed restructuring activities, and the benefit of the write down and disposal of long-lived assets."
