      "csv_string_response": "With a net sales increase of $3.3 million, segment operating income (loss) increased $4.2 million, or 10.8% from $182.2 million in fiscal year 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net sales in the distributor channel across all the APAC and EMEA regions of $13.7 million, a $3.3 million increase in net sales in the OEM channel of the EMEA region and a $4.2 million increase in the EMS channel across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of $1.2 million in the OEM channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. In addition, there was a favorable impact of $7.6 million from foreign currency exchange primarily due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar.",
      "json_rows_response": "For the fiscal years 2018 and 2017, segment operating income was $3.9 million and $5.5 million, respectively. The decrease in segment operating income was primarily due to an increase in net sales and a decrease in net sales of $2.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively. The decrease in segment operating income was primarily attributable to the decline in net sales of $0.5 million and $0.2 million, respectively. The decrease in segment operating income was primarily due to the decline in net sales of $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. These declines were partially offset by the $0.1 million decrease in SG&A expenses and $0.1 million decrease in R&D expenses."
