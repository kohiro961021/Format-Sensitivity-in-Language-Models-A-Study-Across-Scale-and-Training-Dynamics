We revised our preliminary estimate of the working capital adjustment as indicated in the table below. The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation as of closing and as revised (in thousands, except share and per share amounts).\nThe 1,666,667 shares issued at closing of our purchase of Golden Ridge included 380,952 shares that were deposited in an escrow account to be used to satisfy any indemnification obligations of the seller that may arise",
