      "markdown_table_response": "The following table sets forth net sales, operating income (loss) and operating income (loss) as a percentage of net sales for the Film and Electrolytic reportable segment for the fiscal years 2018 and 2017 (amounts in thousands, except percentages):\n(1) Fiscal years ending March 31, 2018 and 2017 adjusted due to the adoption of ASC 606\nNet Sales\nFilm and Electrolytic net sales of $202.0 million in fiscal year 2018 increased $19.7 million or 10.8% from $182.2 million in fiscal year 2017. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in net sales in the distributor channel across all the APAC and EMEA regions of $13.7 million, a $3.3 million increase in net sales in the OEM channel of the EMEA region and a $4.2 million increase in the EMS channel across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of $1.2 million in the OEM channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. In addition, there was a favorable impact of $7.6 million from foreign currency exchange primarily due to the change in the value",
      "csv_string_response": "The percent to net sales was increased by $0.7 million due to the write down and disposal of long-lived assets. The write down of long-lived assets accounted for a $0.4 million improvement in segment operating income for the year and a $0.3 million improvement in segment operating income for the fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to the higher net sales, as well as the benefit of completed restructuring activities.",
