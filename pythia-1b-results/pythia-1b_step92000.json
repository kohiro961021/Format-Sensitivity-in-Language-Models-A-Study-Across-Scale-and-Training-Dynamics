In periods in which the Company has a net loss, dilutive common stock equivalents are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.\nThe table below presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company incurred net losses and accordingly excluded common stock equivalents for outstanding stockbased awards, which represented all potentially dilutive securities, of 2.5 million, 3.7 million, and 4.5 million, respectively, from the calculation of diluted net loss per share due to their anti-dilutive nature."

The Group has applied the new standard on 1 July 2018 using a simplified approach for measuring expected credit losses relating to trade receivables using a lifetime expected loss allowance. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on region and ageing. Customers with heightened credit risk are provided for specifically based on historical default rates and forward looking information. Where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, balances are written-off. The application of the standard did not result in any significant impact on the measurement of the allowance for doubtful debtors.\nCollectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
