Diluted earnings/loss per share reflects the dilutive impact of outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards. Included in the weighted average shares outstanding is the share consideration in connection with the Restaurant Magic Acquisition (See Note 2 - Acquisitions) in the amount of 908,192 for the period after the close of the transaction. The shares were issued in January 2020, however, no contingencies existed as of the date of the acquisition.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the weighted average shares outstanding for the basic and diluted loss per share computations (in thousands):\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018 there were 383,000 and 750,000 incremental shares, respectively, from the assumed exercise of stock options that were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings/loss per share because of the anti-dilutive effect on earnings/loss per share. There were 308,000 restricted stock awards excluded from the computation of diluted earnings/loss per share for the fiscal year ended 2019 and 113,000 for the fiscal year ended 2018.",
