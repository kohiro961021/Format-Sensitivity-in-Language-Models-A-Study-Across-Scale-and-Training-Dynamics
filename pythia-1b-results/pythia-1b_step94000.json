The answer is that all directors receive a compensation package consisting of an annual stock option grant, restricted stock unit award, and stock award that is pro-rated over the annual grant date. The exact amounts for the grants and awards vary by director, but the majority of non-employee directors are granted options to purchase common stock of the company.

The grants and awards are awarded to each of the directors separately, with the options vested in the directors upon the grant date.

The Group has applied the new standard on 1 July 2018 using a simplified approach for measuring expected credit losses relating to trade receivables using a lifetime expected loss allowance. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on region and ageing. Customers with heightened credit risk are provided for specifically based on historical default rates and forward looking information. Where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, balances are written-off. The application of the standard did not result in any significant impact on the measurement of the allowance for doubtful debtors.\nCollectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
