We acquired the business as part of our strategy to vertically integrate in order to leverage our proprietary technologies for producing SRB and derivative products. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. The results of Golden Ridge’s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning November 28, 2018. In 2018, we incurred $0.1 million of Golden Ridge acquisition-related costs which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe purchase price for Golden Ridge was subject to adjustment if the estimated working capital with respect to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed at the time of closing was different than the actual closing working capital, as defined in the purchase agreement. We revised our preliminary estimate of the working capital adjustment as indicated in the table below. The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation as of closing and as revised (in thousands, except share and per share amounts).",
