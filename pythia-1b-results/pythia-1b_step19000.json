      "csv_string_response": "The change in the percentage to net sales for segment operating income (loss) was attributable to the adoption of ASC 606, a new accounting standard for business reports that was adopted in 2017. The adoption of ASC 606 resulted in a $19.7 million increase in net sales, an increase of $12.7 million in operating income and a $12.7 million increase in operating loss. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in net sales in the distributor channel across all the APAC and EMEA regions of $13.7 million, a $3.3 million increase in net sales in the OEM channel of the EMEA region and a $4.2 million increase in the EMS channel across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of $1.2 million in the OEM channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. In addition, a $7.6 million decrease in SG&A expenses was offset by a $7.6 million increase in R&D expenses.",
