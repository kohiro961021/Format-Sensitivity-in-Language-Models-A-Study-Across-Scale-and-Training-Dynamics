      "gold_answer": 6.8,
      "markdown_table_response": "Net sales were $202.0 million in fiscal year 2018, an increase of $19.7 million from $182.2 million in fiscal year 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net sales in the distributor channel across all the APAC and EMEA regions of $13.7 million, a $3.3 million increase in net sales in the OEM channel of the EMEA region and a $4.2 million increase in the EMS channel across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of $1.2 million in the OEM channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions.",
      "csv_string_response": "The answer to this question is:\nThe change in the percentage to net sales for segment operating income (loss) between 2017 and 2018 was due to the adoption of ASC 606, which is a new accounting standard that applies to all businesses and organizations. Under ASC 606, a segment's net sales and operating income (loss) for a fiscal year are calculated by adding the aggregate of net sales and operating income (loss) for the fiscal year. Thus, the percentage to net sales for segment operating income (loss) for a fiscal year 2018 was calculated as follows:\n% to Net Sales for Fiscal Year 2018\n% to Net Sales for Fiscal Year 2017\n% to Gross Margin for Fiscal Year 2018\n% to Gross Margin for Fiscal Year 2017\n% to Gross Margin for Fiscal Year 2018\n% to Gross Margin for Fiscal Year 2017\n% to Gross Margin for Fiscal Year 2018\n% to Gross Margin for Fiscal Year 2017\n% to Gross Margin for Fiscal Year 2018\n% to Gross Margin for Fiscal Year 2017\n% to Gross Margin for Fiscal Year 2018\n% to Gross Margin for Fiscal Year 2017\n% to Gross Margin for Fiscal Year 2018\n%",
      "json_rows_response": "The segment operating income (loss) for the Fiscal Years Ended and 2017 increased $19.7 million or 10.8% from $182.2 million in fiscal year 2017 to $192.2 million in fiscal year 2018. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in net sales of $13.7 million in the distributor channel across all the APAC and EMEA regions of $9.0 million, a $3.3 million increase in net sales in the OEM channel of the EMEA region and a $4.2 million increase in the EMS channel across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of $1.2 million in the OEM channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. In addition, there was a favorable impact of $7.6 million from foreign currency exchange primarily due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar."
