Trade receivables generally have 30 to 90 day terms.\nAASB 9 Financial Instruments This standard addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model based on expected credit losses for the impairment of financial assets. The Group has applied the new standard on 1 July 2018 using a simplified approach for measuring expected credit losses relating to trade receivables using a lifetime expected loss allowance. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on region and ageing. Customers with heightened credit risk are provided for specifically based on historical default rates and forward looking information. Where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, balances are written-off. The application of the standard did not result in any significant impact on the measurement of the allowance for doubtful debtors.\nCollectability of trade receivables is reviewed",

The increase in net sales was primarily driven by an increase in net sales in the distributor channel across all the APAC and EMEA regions of $13.7 million, a $3.3 million increase in net sales in the OEM channel of the EMEA region and a $4.2 million increase in the EMS channel across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of $1.2 million in the OEM channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. In addition, there was a favorable impact of $7.6 million from foreign currency exchange primarily due to the change in the value of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar."
