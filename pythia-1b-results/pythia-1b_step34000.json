Sales in 2019 were higher in the U.S. primarily due to increased system development work in London, Brisbane, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Businesses acquired by CTS in fiscal year 2019, whose operations are all located in the U.S., had sales of $74.4 million in fiscal year 2019. Sales were lower in the UK primarily due to a decrease in system development work in London and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in service sales. Sales decreased in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 primarily due to the impact of currency exchange rates. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS sales of $22.2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Australian"
