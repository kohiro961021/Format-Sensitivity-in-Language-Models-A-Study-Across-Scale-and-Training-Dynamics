      "markdown_table_response": "The table below sets forth the net sales, operating income (loss) and operating income (loss) as a percentage of net sales for our Film and Electrolytic reportable segment for the fiscal years 2018 and 2017 (amounts in thousands, except percentages):\n(1) Fiscal years ending March 31, 2018 and 2017 adjusted due to the adoption of ASC 606\nNet Sales\nFilm and Electrolytic net sales of $202.0 million in fiscal year 2018 increased $19.7 million or 10.8% from $182.2 million in fiscal year 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by an increase in net sales in the distributor channel across all the APAC and EMEA regions of $13.7 million, a $3.3 million increase in net sales in the OEM channel of the EMEA region and a $4.2 million increase in the EMS channel across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales of $1.2 million in the OEM channel across the Americas, APAC, and JPKO regions. In addition, there was a favorable impact of $7.6 million from foreign currency exchange primarily due to the change",
      "csv_string_response": "The percentage to net sales for segment operating income (loss) increased $12.7 million from $9.0 million in 2017 to $9.1 million in 2018. The increase was primarily driven by a $4.3 million increase in gross margin driven by higher net sales, as well as the benefit of completed restructuring activities. The increase was also attributed to an $11.7 million improvement in (gain) loss on the write down and disposal of long-lived assets. These improvements were partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in restructuring charges, a $0.7 million increase in SG&A expenses, and a $0.6 million increase in R&D expenses.",
